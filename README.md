## Getting Started

Checkout the code, either by creating a new repository using this repo as a template, or with degit `npx degit https://github.com/Cazoo-uk/npm-oss-template`.

Edit `package.json` to set the name of your package and the first version.

Add your code and make sure you can run your tests with `npm test`.
